        ‚ö†Ô∏è  This is the most important part of the report ‚ö†Ô∏è
        Without a way to easily reproduce your issue, there is little chance we will be able to help you and work on a fix.
        Please, take the time to show us some code and/or config that is needed for others to reproduce the problem easily.
        A code snippet is sufficient. A failing test is ideal.
